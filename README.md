# Background info

Su: senior in the Molecular Biology and Genetics Department. 
  
  
Adam: Head of DevOps, Cloud, AI and Data. 
  

main goal is to be able to produce new intelligent technologies to help people who are suffering from mental health disorders


  

# Project Idea

  

Creating a technology that is able to detect a psychiatric disorder from the vocal and visual expressions of a person.

- Data science 

## project 0: 
Brain strorm designs 

## project 1: make a list of emotions in an excel spreadsheet,

Randomly create 1000 emotional values 
Read them in with code
create some statistical validation methods
we make it pretty 

## project 2: 
Create a dummy interview process 
pretend we are recording audio, visual , text application
generate a prediction
