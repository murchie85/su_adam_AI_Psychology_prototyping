# High Level Brainstorming


## Su & Adam Values Principles

- People Impact focused
- Practal focused with Results: 
	 - Lets reuse availabe ML tech
	 - We only innovate on areas that are not yet solved or connecting disperate technololgies 

## Ideas 

- Build a program that can detect emotions from `facial expressions`
	- Sub project A
- Build a program that can detect emotions from `audio expressions`
	- Sub project B
- Build a program that can detect emotions from `text expressions`
	- Sub project C
- Build a program that can detect heart rate, blood pressure, temperatuere etc

Full solution is all measurements combined but `weighted` i.e. maybe `visual` is more important than `blood pressure`

We need to build profiles and historical categorisations (via ml training). 

We will need to get contacts in mental health 

We should give confidence ratings of diagnises
  
    
## Interaction Manager 

People with Depression & anxiety struggle at keeping in touch with friends and family.

This causes them more anxiety because they dont' have the energy to reply to everyone.  
  
Assistant: Picks up email, social media tasks 'Sorry, Adam isn't feeling too good at the moment - he will get back to you soon. Thanks for messaging me!`  
  
So the idea is `The AI helps take the social load of the individual`
